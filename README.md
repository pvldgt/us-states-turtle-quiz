# us-states-turtle-quiz
This quiz game was developed following the steps
outlined in the "100 days of code" course on Udemy
https://www.udemy.com/home/my-courses/learning/

The game is build on Python using the turtle graphics library. 

On top of the basic functionality that was provided in the lesson, 
I added a couple of features:
1. When user guesses all the 50 states correctly, the screen displays
a winning message and the game ends. 
2. When user gives up, the screen displays the 'game over' message and creates
a csv file with the states that were not guessed (and that have to be studied).

To give up type 'exit' in the pop up window.
